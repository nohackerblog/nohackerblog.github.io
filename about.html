<h2>About</h2>
<p>
	$ Hello there!
</p>
<p>
	$ My name is Stefan.
</p>
<p>
	$ I am a Computer Science student and I am mainly interested in Cyber Security, Networking, Hardware and
	everything in between.<br>
	$ I like fiddling with stuff (until I break them). I am still at the beginning of my journey and this is a
	very humble blog to document some of my works.
